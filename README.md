# SIMPLE-TEXT-EDITOR
A simple text editor in java using Swing GUI
### How it works:
1. Lets you write simple lines of text.
2. You can save your file using the suboption of save/save as below the file option.
3. If you close the file without saving it asks you once if you want to "continue closing the file without saving" 
4. lets you open other .txt files and shows error message if you open a file which dosen't exist 
### NOTE 
1. This program will only work on an offline java compiler.
2. Use the close option under the "file" menu to close the text file. The 'X' option on the window is for closing the window builder. It will not showcase the features of the close button meant for the text editor
